          <li>1/2 cup Cashew Nuts, soaked in boiling water for at least 15 minutes</li>

      </div>
      <div class="recipe-steps">
        <h3>steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and position a rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
          <li>
            Bring large skillet to medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if
            altering batch size), onion, mushrooms and peppers. Season with salt, herbs and stir. Cook until soft and slightly
            charred - 10-15 minutes, adding the mushrooms in the last few minutes. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare sauce by adding tomato sauce to a mixing bowl and adding seasonings and salt to taste. Adjust seasonings as
            needed. Set aside. Note: If using tomato paste, add water to thin until desired consistency is reached.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare vegan mozzarella if you haven't already by blitzing raw cashews, sea salt, nutritional yeast, miso paste, soy
            milk, Tapioca starch and lemon juics and garlic powder in a food processor until a fine meal is reached. Transfer to
            jar and refrigerate to keep fresh.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out dough onto a floured surface and transfer to a parchment-lined round baking sheet. You're going to add the
            pizza WITH the parchment directly to the oven to properly crisp the crust, so any round object will do as it's not
            actually going into the oven (I use a wood board).
          </li>
          <li>
            Top with desired amount of tomato sauce (you'll have leftovers, which you can store in a jar for later use) and the
            saut√©ed veggies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the baking sheet to gently slide the pizza (WITH the parchment underneath) directly onto the oven rack. The
            parchment will help prevent it from falling through.
          </li>
          <li>Bake for 17-20 minutes or until crisp and golden brown.</li>
          <li>
            Serve with remaining mozzarella cheese and dried oregano and red pepper flake. Leftovers keep well - no need to
            reheat! Cold pizza is yum.
          </li>
